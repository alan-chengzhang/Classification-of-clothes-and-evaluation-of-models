# Midterm_project_Applied-Data-Science-GR5243

Please be aware that there materials can just be used for personal study. DO NOT use them for profit.

It's a midterm project of a group of three of the course Applied Data Science.
The project focuses on an image recognition problem. We constructed a variety of machine learning 
models with the goal of generating predictive classifications. 

We used the following 9 models to do the prediction, including: 
LASSO, LDA, LDA.PCA, KNN, Ridge.PCA, Random Forest, Neural Network, SVM, Xgboost and ensemble model.
Then, we created a score of model performance based on the amount of data used, the running time for trainning the model and the overall accuracy
of the model. Finally, we evaluated and modified models based on the scores.

The analysis, together with the report is written in a Rmarkdown file and directly generated by Rstudio, 
which makes the analysis procedure highly reproduceable.

For more information about the data and requirements, please refer to the instruction document.
